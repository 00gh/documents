# Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing

This repository contains a proposal for a secure and privacy-preserving decentralized privacy-preserving proximity tracing system. Its goal is to simplify and accelerate the process of identifying people who have been in contact with an infected person, thus providing a technological foundation to help slow the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The system aims to minimise privacy and security risks for individuals and communities and guarantee the highest level of data protection.

By publishing this document we seek feedback from a broad audience on the high-level design, its security and privacy properties, and the functionality it offers; so that further protection mechanisms can be added if weaknesses are identified. The [white paper document](DP3T White Paper.pdf) is accompanied by an [overview of the data protection aspects of the design](DP3T - Data Protection and Security.pdf), and a [three page simplified introduction to the protocol](DP3T - Simplified Three Page Brief.pdf).
