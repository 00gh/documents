# Engagement Comic

This comic was made by [Nicky Case](https://ncase.me/) to explain how DP-3T works to a wider audience. It is simplified for communication, and not an exact representation of the protocol. For example, the low cost version of the protocol does not allow you to choose the times you upload, whereas the higher cost one using Cuckoo filters does (as per version April 8).

The original URL you can use to easily view the comic is https://ncase.me/contact-tracing/. The whole website is in the public domain, licensed CC-0, and [available on GitHub](https://github.com/ncase/ncase.github.io).

We would like help *translating the comic*! Please translate (fonts are Patrick Hand and Open Sans) and if you send the files or notify m.veale@ucl.ac.uk, we will upload them to the repo for others to use. If possible, we would appreciate you also licensing your translations CC-0.
